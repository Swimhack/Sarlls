Subject: Re: Required design files for quote
To: (Aziz’s email)

Hi Aziz,

Thanks for the guidance and links. I’ve prepared the manufacturing package to match the MacroFab requirements:

- PCB layers: RS-274X Gerbers + NC drill in a single zip
- Bill of Materials: CSV ready and convertible to .xlsx if needed
- Component placement: merged .XYRS (tab-delimited, mils, Top=1 / Bottom=2)

I can upload these to the MacroFab portal for an instant quote. If you prefer, I can also share them directly by reply (or a shared link).

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences (e.g., require .xlsx BoM instead of CSV, or any custom PCB specification fields you want pre-filled).

Thanks again—will keep you posted once the upload is complete.

Best regards,
