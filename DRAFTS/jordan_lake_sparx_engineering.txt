Subject: First-time PCB design (ESP32 smart switch) – looking for review + prototype help
To: jlake@sparxeng.com

Hi Jordan,

I’m James Strickland. I’m designing my first PCB, an ESP32 smart switch for home/IoT use. I’ve prepared the core manufacturing package (Gerber zip, merged .XYRS placement, and BOM) and would value Sparx Engineering’s help to review and finalize the design, then plan a prototype run.

What I’m hoping to cover:
- Design-for-manufacture/test review and recommendations
- Power/safety considerations and component substitutions
- Bring-up/test strategy
- Prototype build plan and next steps to production

If you’re available, I’d love to schedule a brief intro call this week. Happy to share the files and a one-pager beforehand.

Thanks,
James Strickland
