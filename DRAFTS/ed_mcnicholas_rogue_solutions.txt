Subject: ESP32 smart switch – first board design + prototype support
To: emcnicholas@roguesolutionsengineering.com

Hi Ed,

I’m James Strickland, working on my first PCB: an ESP32-based IoT smart switch. I’ve assembled the core manufacturing files (Gerber zip, merged .XYRS, and BOM) and want expert help to review the design, tighten up for manufacturability, and plan a path to prototypes and early production.

Areas where I’d appreciate Rogue’s guidance:
- Design review for reliability, EMC, and safety
- Component risk/lead time alternatives
- Test/bring-up strategy and fixture suggestions
- Prototype build and transfer to production

Could we set up a short intro call? I can send the files and brief ahead of time.

Best regards,
James Strickland
