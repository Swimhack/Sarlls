Subject: New ESP32 smart switch – first board design review and prototype support
To: richard.nie@arcserv.com

Hi Rick,

My name is James Strickland. I’m developing my first PCB (ESP32-based smart switch) and have assembled the initial manufacturing files (Gerber zip, merged .XYRS, and BOM). I’m seeking a partner to review the design, advise on DFM/DFT, and support a prototype build with a plan toward production.

Could ARC Technology Solutions assist with:
- Schematic/Layout review and risk reduction
- Component alternatives and availability planning
- Test/bring-up approach and fixture guidance
- Prototype spin and production readiness

If so, may we schedule a short intro call? I can share the files and a brief scope in advance.

Thank you,
James Strickland
