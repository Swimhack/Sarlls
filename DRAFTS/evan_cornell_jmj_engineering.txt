Subject: New IoT smart switch project – first board design help
To: evan.cornell@jmjengineeringconsulting.com

Hi Evan,

My name is James Strickland, and I’m starting my first PCB project: an ESP32-based IoT smart switch. I have a preliminary design and manufacturing files ready (Gerber zip, merged .XYRS placement, and BOM). I’m looking for an experienced partner to review the design, advise on best practices, and help finalize a production-ready first board, with the option to support quick-turn prototypes and low-volume builds.

Scope I’m seeking help with:
- Schematic and layout review for DFM/DFT/EMC
- Part substitutions and supply risk mitigation
- Test points/bring-up plan
- Prototype spin and production ramp recommendations

If this fits your wheelhouse, could we schedule a quick intro call this week? I can share the current files and requirements ahead of time.

Thanks,
James Strickland
