*** PLACEHOLDER GERBER SET – NOT A FUNCTIONAL PCB ***
----------------------------------------------------
This archive was generated automatically from your CPL placements.
It includes:
  - Top/Bottom copper (GTL/GBL)
  - Top/Bottom solder mask (GTS/GBS)
  - Top/Bottom silkscreen (GTO/GBO)
  - Mechanical outline (GKO)
  - NC drill file (.DRL)

IMPORTANT:
  • There is NO schematic, NO routed nets/traces, NO footprints with
    correct pad geometry or pin mapping. Pads are flashed as generic
    round features at part centers only.
  • Through-hole components from your BOM are NOT represented (no
    pin patterns). The drill file contains only 4 mounting holes.
  • Do NOT fabricate or assemble this board. This is a scaffold for
    viewer/pre-check only.

To produce a true fab-ready set:
  1) Lock the architecture (controller driving an external automotive
     contactor for battery isolation).
  2) Build the schematic and use real footprints that match your BOM.
  3) Route nets, add copper widths/clearances per current & automotive
     derating, add solder-mask openings, silks, keep-outs and test pads.
  4) Re-export Gerbers + NC drill + BOM + CPL.
